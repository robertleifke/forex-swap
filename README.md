#### Automated market maker for hedging on-chain FX markets. 

## Overview

Automated market makers enable [instant cross-border payments](https://app.uniswap.org/OnchainFX.pdf) (e.g. USDC -> EUROC), but currently can't hedge the exchange rate risk for conditional one such as recurring or future payments, a critical problem for businesses and global remittances. For anyone looking to lock in a specific exchange rate for a specific time, Numo can do so for any FX pair without needing to find a counterparty.

### FX Forwards

Numo is is a log-normal AMM that is built as a [Uniswap V4](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/overview) hook. It's trading curve enables the construction of synthetic derivative exposures, with cash-settled FX forwards being the most powerful application. Forwards allow anyone to lock in an exchange rate for a specific time. Under the hood, each forward is a liquidity provider (LP) position in Numo repersented as an `ERC-20`. Arbitrageurs then rebalance the LP position so that the desired payoff of a forward is always maintained. In other words, the exhange rate is always maintained. This process is known as *payoff replication* and typically done by sophicated market makers when their is an illiquid market.  Similar to traditional forwards, users set a pair of `strikes` and an `expiry` to match their needs.  

### Advantages 

- ‚úÖ No exchange rate risk
- üåç Globally accessible
- ü§ù No reliance on counterparties
- üõ†Ô∏è Customizability 

#### Acknowledgements

The smart contract suite is inspired by Primitive's [RMM](https://github.com/primitivefinance/rmm) implementation and the [replicating market makers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14769) paper that first proved that any synethic derivative expsoure can be constructed using AMMs without needing a liquid options market.
