#### Automated market maker for FX derivatives on the EVM.

## Overview

Automated market makers (AMM) can quickly bootstrap liquidity on any market without external prices. Numo, a specialized AMM is designed to do just that for a host of hedging products such as futures, forwards, and exotic option instruments. A useful application of Numo is hedging FX risk on long-tail currencies where Numo uses option premiums to peg a FX pair to a desired exchange rate (e.g. USD/EUR 1:1.2). Unlocking savings for cross-border lending, payments, and exchange.

### Advantages 

- ‚úÖ Any derivative exposure
- üåç Globally accessible
- ü§ù No reliance on counterparties
- üõ†Ô∏è Customizability 

## Architecture

Numo is a Uniswap V4 hook that inherits OpenZeppelin's `BaseCustomCurve` contract from their `uniswap-hooks` library. Thus enabling Numo to interact with the V4 poolmanager for optimal routing and inherit much of their battle tested code without needing use the concentrated liquidity logic. Instead of calling `beforeSwap` directly, Numo.sol implements its custom curve in `_getUnspecifiedAmount` to support the replication of derivatives. Each call and put is repersented as a `ERC-6909` token. 

#### Trading curve

The trading curve in Numo determines the price and behavior of the AMM. Unlike a traditional AMM like in Uniswap V2, Numo implements a log-normal curve to adjust prices dynamically based on volatility (œÉ), strike (K), and time to maturity (œÑ). It allows users to swap assets at implied vol-adjusted prices, mimicking an options market.***The formula***:

Implemented in `computeTradingFunction(...)` with the following parameters:

- Reserve balances `reserveX`, `reserveY`
- Liquidity `totalLiquidity`
- Strike price `strike`
- Implied volatility `sigma`
- Time to maturity `tau`

#### Acknowledgements

The smart contract suite is inspired by Primitive's [RMM](https://github.com/primitivefinance/rmm) implementation and the [replicating market makers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14769) paper that first proved that any synethic derivative expsoure can be constructed using AMMs without needing a liquid options market.
