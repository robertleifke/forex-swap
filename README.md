## Overview

Numo is a dynamic, automated market maker that provides continuous liquidity to onchain FX markets. Numo's specialized curve can offer more efficient exchange of FX and market make a variety of derivative products such as futures, forwards, and exotic option instruments without oracles.

Try it out at [numosend.com](numosend.com)! Send money from one currency to another at the best rates  without waiting or amount limits. 

### Advantages 

- ‚úÖ Any FX pair
- üåç Globally accessible
- ü§ù Instant settlement

## Architecture

Numo is a Uniswap V4 hook that inherits OpenZeppelin's `BaseCustomCurve` contract from their `uniswap-hooks` library. Thus enabling Numo to interact with the V4 poolmanager for optimal routing and inherit much of their battle tested code without needing use the concentrated liquidity logic. 

#### Log-Normal Market Maker

A log-normal curve is beter suited for FX over hyperbolic curves implemented by Uniswap as FX exchange rates exhbit log-normal behavior. Instead of overriding `beforeSwap` completey, Numo uses  `_getUnspecifiedAmount` to implement the curve defined as:

$$ \varphi(x, y, L; \mu, \sigma) = \Phi^{-1} \left(\frac{x}{L} \right) + \Phi^{-1} \left(\frac{y}{\mu L} \right) + \sigma $$

where:
- $\Phi^{-1}$ is the **inverse** Gaussian cumulative distribution function (CDF).
- $L$ represents the total liquidity of the pool.
- $x$ and $y$ represent the reserves scaled by liquidity.
- $\mu$, the mean and $\sigma$, the width define the distribution of liquidity.

As liquidity $L$ increases, both reserves scale proportionally, maintaining a log-normal liquidity distribution.

#### Acknowledgements

The smart contract suite is inspired by Primitive's Log-Normal [DFMM](https://github.com/primitivefinance/dfmm) implementation and the [replicating market makers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14769) paper that first showed the relationship between liquidity and the trading curve of an AMM.
